### gene_presence_absence.csv

A csv file describing which gene is in which sample. If a gene cluster is present in a sample, the sequence name of the representative for that sample is given in the matrix. The corresponding DNA and protein sequence can then be matched to those found in the `combined_DNA_CDS.fasta` and `combined_protein_CDS.fasta` files. The format is the same as that given by [Roary](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/).
